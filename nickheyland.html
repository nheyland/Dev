                    I started my journey to becoming a pilot. I washed dishes for a local diner, and using every penny I had, I paid for my flight lessons.

                    In 2018, my interest in software peaked. I had seen a project called the metar map which shows pilots different weather categories on a physical geographically accurate map. I used others code to build my own. I still
                    have the original, but I can confirm, it is not wuite presentable. Little did I know I would later go on to write my own software for my map in 2020.

                    2019 was one of the biggest years of my life. I spend hours of my day teaching student pilots, but also spent time studying to receiving both my CFII and my Commercial Multi License. I also graduated with Magna Cum Laude
                    from Bridgewater State University. I later went on to teach at the school it all began, Southern Maine Aviation.

                    Just before the pandemic of 2020, I worked 7 days a week to hit my ATP requried minimums to meet my deadline to join Republic Airways as a First Officer on the E175. About one week into training, I was sent home, the
                    company was slowing operations because the pandemic has had virtually shut down the aviation industry entierly. After one month of not flying, I couldn't just sit around anymore, and went back to teaching as soon as my
                    flight school opened.

                    After years of hard work, and suddeny my world coming to a stop, I realized I could never really give up flying. I continued and even to this day spend my weekends teaching student pilots, and my weekdays working at

                    After my interest peaked in software development, I became extremely curious about what I could do next. I was discouraged by the fact that I had an aviation degree, and had never taken any classes in software
                    development whatsoever. Foreflight, an app and software that I had used for as long as I had been flying opened a position in Portland Maine for a QA Analyst. Without having any idea what this meant, I applied. Somehow I
                    got the job. Even to this day I am still extremely greatful I have joined this company. I haven't been there long, but it certainly changed my life so far.

                    With my new found love for technology, and after spending all day looking at other peoples 'bugs' I decided to make the commitment to start a new journey to become a software developer. I enrolled in a coding
                    bootcamp called the coding dojo. And took off writing my own code.
